# 🧠 Alzheimer's Detection and Classification

This repository contains a deep learning-based approach for detecting and classifying Alzheimer's disease using CNNs. The project includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a GUI for user-friendly interaction.

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying Alzheimer's disease using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to analyze MRI scans and classify them into different stages of Alzheimer's. The project includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 [Best Alzheimer's MRI Dataset - 99% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukechugh/best-alzheimer-mri-dataset-99-accuracy)

It contains MRI scans categorized into different stages:
✅ Mild Dementia  
✅ Moderate Dementia  
✅ Non-Demented  
✅ Very Mild Dementia  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **MATLAB** (GUI Development)
- **Deep Learning** (MobileNetV2 for feature extraction)

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Load MRI images for classification  
✔️ Use a trained CNN model to predict the stage of Alzheimer's  
✔️ Train a new model if required  
✔️ User-friendly MATLAB-based GUI  

## 📌 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvnikhitha/Alzheimer-detection-and-classification.git
cd Alzheimer-detection-and-classification
```

### 2️⃣ Run the GUI
Open MATLAB and run:
```matlab
alzheimers_gui
```

### 3️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model, ensure your dataset is available in the correct directory and run:
```matlab
trainCNNModel()
```

## 📊 Model Training Details
- Pretrained **MobileNetV2** model is used for feature extraction.
- The final layers are replaced to classify MRI images into Alzheimer's stages.
- **Adam optimizer** is used for training.

## 🎯 Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset, making it a reliable tool for Alzheimer's detection.
